# _Cookie Recipe_

#### _Demonstration Website For A Cookie Recipe_

## Technologies Used

* _A Computer
* _A Web Browser

## Description

_Demonstration of concepts like adding images and hyperlinks to a webpage and practice with ordered and un-ordered lists. I have not tried the cookie recipe, as it was a practice exercise provided by www.learnhowtoprogram.com and it did not provide proper measurements. I've always hated recipes that say to add an ingredient "to taste" but this one doesn't even give that much! Plus, coconut and oatmeal in a chocolate chip cookie? You're overthinking it._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Have A Computer_
* _Have A Web Browser_

_Use your computer's web browser to navigate to github.com, get to JuliaC652's cookie-recipe file and download the .html file. Open the .html file and look at the website. Or have a person or robot read the website to you. Technology is revolutionizing accessibility._

## Known Bugs

* _The Cookie Image Link Is False_
* _The Recipe Itself Is A Disaster_
* _Even Though Nestle is Evil, Use Their Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe (Without the Nestle Products If Possible)_

_If you have any questions, want me to fix the cookie image, or update the recipe that works a little better (try using only 1 egg!), just email me at JuliaC652@yahoo.com._
